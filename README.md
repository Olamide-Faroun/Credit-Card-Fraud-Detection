**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This project explores the performance of different machine learning methods to detect fraudulent credit card transactions on a highly imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions.

	•	Data Cleaning and feature engineering 
	•	Data preprocessing: Balancing the dataset using SMOTE, NearMiss Algorithm and SMOTE-ENN
	•	Model training and evaluation.

**Project Overview**

	•	Goal: Develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions while minimising false positive and negatives.
	•	Methods Used: 
 
	◦	Descriptive statistical analysis
	◦	Data preprocessing
